When we had a few outages earlier this year, we made sure that the drivers who were active at the time were &quot;made whole&quot; by paying them for the time we were down.<p>Yes, there were issues a few years ago with statements and actions that were done, but the Uber today and the employees that work here now take a lot of pride in what they do.

Hey Siri&#x2F;Google already does this, no? also, how many people have 50$ wifi connected bulbs? and isn&#x27;t the most convenient way to turn on a light switch still just physically flipping the switch? (they&#x27;re usually located right where you need them)\\nis it for shopping? this seems like still a rare use case.\\nis it to check the weather? that&#x27;s already on your phone&#x2F;wrist&#x2F;computer&#x2F;tv&#x2F;window.\\nis it to look up facts? again, siri&#x2F;cortana&#x2F;heygoogle does this.<p>it&#x27;s possible that i&#x27;m not the target demographic, that i&#x27;m the only person who doesnt have literally everything in their home futuristically connected (locks, lights, windows, curtains, vacuums, etc) -- and that this is actually solving a huge problem for a lot of people. but that seems unlikely -- i live in a relatively tech-infested city (SF) and almost nobody i know has those things.<p>maybe i&#x27;m too old (27) to &quot;get it&quot;? get off my lawn??',E'13227211',E'1527858006',E'1482301828',E'comment',E'hijohnnylin');

It could just be what I&#x27;ve seen from my friends but a lot of the times you can tell from the box art and title alone that you&#x27;re going to need tiles, tokens, cards a 3 page manual and a practice round before you can even start. For me, that&#x27;s a slog. It&#x27;s too hard to hold conversation or focus on anything other than the game. I guess there will always be a divide between people who can spend 3 hours of intense concentration on a Settlers of Catan game and people who just want to play Jenga for a few rounds.
